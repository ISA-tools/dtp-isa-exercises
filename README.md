# Exercises for creating ISA-based experimental descriptions

This repositories contains exercises demonstrating how to build [ISA](http://isa-tools.org)-based experimental descriptions programmatically and based on concepts from the study design.

The exercises are presented in the form of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to be run with Python 3.

## Run in binder

You can run the notebooks in this repository using the [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) tool by clicking on the button below:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ISA-tools/dtp-isa-exercises/master?filepath=exercise.ipynb)

For more information on how the Binder tool works, check [its documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io).

## Run in your local machine

You can also choose to run the notebooks in your local machine, as detailed below. 

If you do not want to use a [virtual environment](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/), skip the first two steps below:

1. ```virtualenv my_project```
2. ```source my_project/bin/activate```
3. ```pip install -r requirements.txt``
4. ```jupyter notebook```
